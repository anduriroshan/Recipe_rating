Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed.  So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes.  After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid.  I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added.  The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious.  Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I&#39;d like.

We, like so many others, begin with this basic recipe and enhance it to meet our specific tastes by sauteeing onions, carrots, celery, baby spinach, one minced clove of garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and one tablespoon of Madeira wine with the mushrooms before blending everything.   Before adding the cream, I put half of the blended mix into a freezer container and allow it to cool completely before freezing.

I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn&#39;t work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn&#39;t look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it.  Well, after all this, I still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was SO delicious and adictive!"

Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I&#39;m going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US)"

But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeÃ±os and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.

Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.

As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature."

Different people like different things.  I quite like both this version and the ones made in Italian kitchens.  You will find differences in recipes from your own Mario and Giada, and I&#39;m not sure I would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are, Martin.

I had a little trouble getting them off the first pan, but I think that&#39;s because I let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack.  For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because they were still hot and soft or because it was a different type of pan, but I&#39;ll transfer them immediately from now on.  GREAT RECIPE!"
