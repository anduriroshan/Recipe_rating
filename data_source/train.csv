So easy to put together and good flavour.  The only things I did differently were to put a ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in, instead of the hot sauce  and I chopped the vegetables fine with my hand blender after they were cooked and then added the milk mixture. This recipe went into my “keep” file!"

So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn’t really change anything. But the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients.

I still have the original recipe that I cut out and have now laminated!  That is how amazing this recipe is!  When I first met my husband 20 years ago he hated meatloaf.  I tried many recipes and he literally hated them all, until I made this one.  I have never made any other meatloaf since we first made this recipe.  It is super easy to make and it turns out perfectly delicious every single time.  The sauce is absolutely amazing!  I have never changed a thing and everyone who tries it loves it.  Now that we are in our 40&#39;s we are trying to watch what we eat.  So I decided to substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and I kept everything else the same... PERFECT!  It was even more moist than normal.  Beef or turkey, this recipe is absolute perfection!"

Next time though I&#39;ll follow the advice of a previous review and add the Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce.  My family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed.  Instead I&#39;ll just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking.  I used 2.25 pounds of ground beef instead of 1.5 pounds because that&#39;s how it was packaged and I didn&#39;t have a need to save a small amount.  It still turned out fantastic.  Much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like I&#39;ve always done before.

This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I’d say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup!

Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it&#39;s frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients.

It was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy. In fact I was skeptical about it! Took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy. Proceeded on with the room temperature egg, etc. I did use the hand mixer for adding in the first 1-1/2 cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring. Then I made all the balls up. Then I got out a little bowl and put 1/4 cup sugar in as a guesstimate. I rolled the balls in that. It was more than enough. I baked mine 10.5 minutes in a gas oven. Took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up. They are just perfect. Outside is firm but inside is soft. Best ginger cookie recipe ever!! Hope they will stay soft."

I didn’t have any poppyseeds so left those out and I couldn’t find any horseradish “spread” at my local grocery store so I used just the tiniest pinch of regular prepared horseradish on the bottom of each bun. I also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day. My teenage daughter who is THE pickiest eater on planet Earth loved them. Tomorrow night I am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner.

When the onions and mushrooms were cooked I added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme.   I also added a splash (1/4 cup) of sherry to the broth.    Let it boil for about 15min then added whipping cream, some more butter,  another &#34;splash&#34; of sherry and some fresh lemon juice.   Shimmered for about 1/2hr.  Pulled out a 1/2 cup of mushrooms,  then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot.   Added back the mushrooms set aside.

I used onion strips rather than cubed to go with pepper strips. I had smoked chicken breasts (so pre-cooked) that I cut into strips and marinaded for an hour. They absorbed the marinade and were incredible.  These marinated strips are great by themselves and could be used on salads, in a pasta etc. I&#39;ll use this marinade with smoked chicken breasts by themselves now. So delicious. Fajitas were great too."

I made it again Wednesday for another family and didn&#39;t get back home before my cellphone was ringing with their praises! I did take some hints from other reviewers by using pre-cooked bacon and some bacon grease saved in my fridge. I had frozen some homemade chicken stock,  (which I always save when I am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken) and milk in place of water and bouillon, and as I only had 2 cups cheddar when I made it the first time, I added a cup of Colby-Jack I had on hand. It was so good I decided to use the same combo again. The first time I used a whole, drained can of Niblets, and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn, thawed. Both worked great. I did finely chop a rib of celery to saute  with the onion and carrot both times. I am delighted to have a new soup recipe that is so good I can&#39;t wait to make it again."

If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can&#39;t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little &#39;bite&#39; in your mouth after eating it.

Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won&#39;t crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family&#39;s tastes.  BUEN PROVECHO"

It&#39;s a time consuming recipe, but it&#39;s just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is. I added 5 garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it, but that extra seasoning didn&#39;t go far enough to make this have real flavor. If you like plain food, then you&#39;d like this. But if I were to make it again, I would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure. The casserole doesn&#39;t really have any sauce to it, and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole, leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato. There are other spaghetti casserole recipes I would try here before this one. It&#39;s really not that good."

It never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results.  Toll house cookies being the prime example.  Anyway, sorry, I did change it a little.  I have made macaroons before and just wanted to experiment--however, I didn&#39;t change any measurements just tweaked things a little.  I used almond flour, rum instead of vanilla, added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top.  They&#39;re fabulous but I mainly wanted to mention how they came together.  They didn&#39;t but I piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet, anyway, and they&#39;re fine.  Also, this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients, made 23 big macaroons.  Macaroons are so rich and sweet and, basically unhealthy, most recipes don&#39;t recommend making them very big.  Can&#39;t figure out how people could think the recipe doesn&#39;t make enough.  Last of all, I think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference.  Staler egg whites are watery.  I could have used a little of that."

I used 1.5 pounds of shrimp (12 ounces), 1 pound (16 ounce) of REAL jumbo lump crab meat, and 1.5 pounds of bay scallops (12 ounces).  I doubled everything else.  I also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and I added the garlic just before I added the broth and juices.  I used Costco&#39;s fresh, aged parmigiano reggiano cheese.  My sauce was not bland at all!  It was thick, rich and decadent!  Also, in the doubling process, I used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice.  Be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn&#39;t runny.  Additionally, because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking, I put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  It was perfect!  While the seafood makes the dish costly, it was well worth it!  I will certainly be making it again!"

Other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas, I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I don&#39;t really change anything.  The only adjustment I made is that I now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and I use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink.  It makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way.  I also quit measuring everything.  I just add as much or as little of everything that I want.  Always good.  It&#39;s hard to screw up.

I would think this would overcook the chops.  Chops are best at 145° f,  which is USDA safe for today&#39;s pork.  I have found browning is often sufficient to nearly reach this temp.  Cooking according to this recipe is a throwback to when a pork chop had to be cooked until it was dry. Cooking above 145°f squeezes the internal fat and juice out of the meat fibers as they contract. The hotter the meat, the more squeezing.  Pork today is much leaner than years ago when it had to be cooked much higher to be safe to eat (to avoid Trichinosis).  I suggest baking the potatoes and sauce first then add the browned meat maybe the last 15 minutes depending on the internal temperature of the browned chops.  Ideally, pull when the meat reaches 145°f."

When I read the ingredients it sounded like nothing I ever tried so I wanted to review it for sure. I was expecting them to be really sweet but they weren&#39;t at all. The batter was much thicker than I am used to but that was just fine. I didn&#39;t have whole wheat flour so I just used regular and I had no buttermilk so I used what I had in the fridge. The only thing I would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because I didn&#39;t realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well. If someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them. Great recipe really nice job I will make it again for sure.

I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn&#39;t add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t made this before I didn&#39;t make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer&#39;s comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don&#39;t like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I&#39;d put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I&#39;ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that&#39;s 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese.  Really pleased to find this recipe  - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I&#39;m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it&#39;s bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten."

I did however make a few changes do to my liking of clam chowders i&#39;ve had in the past. i added a small carrot finely diced. Instead of 1 cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice. I also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice. i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didn&#39;t need the flour. Sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cooked..It was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again. This is the second time i&#39;ve made it so i knew it needed some tweaking.

He used full-fat Miracle Whip and packaged pre-cooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade. He cut the onion to one and used a mild onion. The chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that. Using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off. Since he made it the night before, the dressing and onions had time to mellow.Exchanges I&#39;d make in the future would be half Miracle Whip and half yogurt, trying plain and then lemon. For salad meal, I&#39;d add add cheese cubes, ham, chicken, summer sausage, that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Maybe whole grain pasta. Fresh or frozen peas, maybe pineapple tidbits or tomatoes.This was good as is but can be used as a base to expand ingredients."

Update: On the warm up with leftovers did get very dry, if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup, or make more roux. Still delicious even dry!"

I used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true.  Two tips abou the pie filling.  1). I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups.  This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning.  Juicy but not runny.  2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially.  I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done.  Baked another 30 minutes, checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking.  Apples should be nice and &#34;oozy&#34; and very tender.  With these two minor modifications, fabulous results!"

It&#39;s what you grew up with, what your grandma made and what you came to love. Nowhere does this recipe claim to be &#34;southern&#34; cornbread. Or &#34;northern&#34; cornbread. Make your cornbread however you like, just don&#39;t tell me my way is wrong."

I can&#39;t see why one person thought it had too many &#34;flaws&#34; and why some are so spooked by the fact that there&#39;s one and a half cups of water in the topping!  There are many dessert recipes where you use a lot of liquid like this to pour over the main part of the dessert....it combines with the flour and creates that lovely thick sauce that was underneath the cake-like topping and peaches.  Someone even contemplated leaving the topping off....that would be disastrous!  Follow the recipe as it&#39;s written, use nice, juicy ripe peaches, and it makes a terrific cobbler.

I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter."

I didn&#39;t have celery salt the first time I made it, so I used 3/4 tsp celery seed and increased the seasoned salt to 1 tsp. It worked out well, so that&#39;s what I continue to do.

The answer to your question is.. are you using cheese that is already shredded? I found this out the hard way when I was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese. If you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn&#39;t stick together. Also you don&#34;t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store. So freshness does matter. It is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself. Since I have been doing that, all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly. I got this tip from Paula Dean. It was a question she answered from her cooking magazine. I hope this helped you."

I&#39;ve been wanting to make a pot pie for years; my grandma used to make them, but i dont have her recipe, so just beginning to experiment.   It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid.   Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn&#39;t think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello &#39;shrooms  (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions.   I pretty much followed all the other measurements.  Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great.  My two boys &amp; wife loved it; it was gone in minutes.

Great for a rainy day.  I used fresh thyme, not dried. Used a small dice for the potatoes.  I used whole fat half and half cuz I couldn&#39;t find fat free.  I made the roux in a separate pot, using about 1/4 cup of flour instead of 1/3, and stirred it into the potato clam juice mixture.  My potatoes were soft but a little teeny bit firm at about 12 minutes.  I found that I didn&#39;t really need very much thinning at the end so I used only about 1/4 cup of the half and half there.  Result was a lovely delicious thick and creamy chowder that is the best I&#39;ve ever made.  Served it with fresh baguette bread and butter.

I wouldn&#39;t change a thing, except that with my oven I needed about 10 minutes more baking time. Oh, and I used 4 different types of apples (Granny Smith, jazz, pink lady, and braeburn). As others have stated, the batter was indeed quite stiff, but my little Sunbeam mixer could still handle it. When it was time to stir in the apples, the fruit-to-batter ratio was very high; no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist! Speaking of which?don?t worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven. After it?s mostly cooled, cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender. As with most cakes, it&#39;s better the second day. I think the cake stands on its own without the sauce, but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat. I added a few drops of butter-rum extract, just for fun. I will make this sauce again for other things (ice cream, or a dip for apples, for example). Five stars!"

Each :cumin, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and a scant TOregano. (1/4t. salt is optional. )  I round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder .But a mix of regular and  chipolte chilli powder  is good too. That will taste just like the envelope or BETTER according to reviews  Plus no sodium. Also look for fat free refried beans... 85 % lean or ground turkey (needs a tad more seasoning) lowers the fat.

Our family does like a little extra flavour in our food, so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for. And I did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later. Apart from the basic recipe: I added 1 can black beans, 1 diced green pepper, 1 diced white onion, 1/2 can leftover tomato soup (just to avoid wasting it.) Some cumin, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parsley, adobo seasoning, chipotle chile powder, and about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and some more water. I added black olives to mine but not the entire pot, because a lot of people hate olives. I love them though and they are a great addition! Then we topped as desired with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips when serving. It worked out great. This recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you / stretch it for extra servings. I would have never thought about using the ranch dressing packet but that was a good idea."

This is a fantastic recipe when you have fresh peaches in the summer. It&#39;s probably good with frozen or canned peaches too, but I save this for when I have fresh ones. For the topping, you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter, think like syrup or even a caramel consistency. I add a little corn syrup to the topping mix just to prevent any crunchy sugar bits. The cream as indicated by the recipe is good, but some ice cream I think is even better.

Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead.  Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the &#34;set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours&#34; deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you&#39;re looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I&#39;ve used rapid rise yeast that&#39;s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly.  However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date.  Dissolving it in water that&#39;s too hot will do it in too.  Best to have the water 105? to 110?.  If you set it  out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising.  I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it&#39;s around 100?.  That seems to work well for rising.  If the dough doesn&#39;t rise even after it&#39;s set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead."

With this, I scaled up the amount of each ingredient - 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4ths tsp of vanilla, and three egg whites.

I didn&#39;t have clam juice but I had shrimp shells saved in the freezer so I boiled those for broth and used that in place of the clam juice and it worked good. I made a double batch. I also had less than half the onion called for, but I had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions. I ended up adding 1 extra can of clams.. first reason was because I bought a pallet of them on clearance. Yeah. I thought it was a good move. And I wanted the extra clams because I was short on that clam juice. -- Also, I&#39;m going to try it again lower carb by only using 1 small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and I might try cream cheese in place of the flour.

I was out of instant pudding, so I used the Cook &amp; Serve pudding, cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese. The pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese.

I recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it. This helps with the flavor.

It&#39;s not worth all the trouble, so I don&#39;t think I would bother making it again."

May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper.  Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don&#39;t use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies.  Sometimes bacon with the pepperoni (WHY NOT?!?!)  After it&#39;s done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired.  They love to help make it, too, so are happy to eat it :)"

I initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough &#39;sauce&#39; but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough. I did, however, deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan. That didn&#39;t create more &#39;sauce&#39; because it evaporated - just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan. But that  I used leftover pork roast (cubed up) instead of ground pork. I also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon (it needed more of that ingredient in my mind). Next time I make it I will probably use 2 oz. of the noodles instead of 4 (just personal preference - I would like more cabbage ratio than noodle). I did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan - didn&#39;t need it necessarily but I liked the added richness it provided. I added some chopped cilantro on top as I served it. This is a keeper and for me that&#39;s a big deal. I rarely go by recipes but I followed this one to the &#34;T&#34; and it was great."

I changed it a bit with fine results. Here&#39;s what I did: omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar, used a tad more flour(maybe a few extra tablespoons because I did not measure flour exactly), used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. I used whole walnuts, not chopped walnuts. Toward the end of baking (last 20 minutes) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees. This came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread I have tried.   I also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following:  white rice flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, pectin and xanthan gum.  The raw batter was thick going into the pan.  Once the butter and sugar were  creamed, I basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas, and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute.  I liked the sprinkled nuts on top(which I did not measure) as opposed to mixing them into the batter. I just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts.  The nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good, too!   By the way, there is no milk in this recipe.   Perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy.  I like to alter recipes when I don&#39;t have all the ingredients on hand.   I also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas, which I had plenty of today  : )"

Making bread is not an exact science.  The amount of flour you use isn&#39;t going to exactly match what is in this recipe.  (or any recipe)  The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity.  If it&#39;s cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour.  You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough.  Don&#39;t add all the flour at once.   It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan.  This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust)"

To get it right,  you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration. I found starting at 400 for 40 minutes and then dropping the temp to 300 in a convection oven for 90 minutes to be successful.  The cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as I can tell using a toothpick to test the softness. Feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own.

I added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and I had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpected.I also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold. I agree the steps should be reversed. Cook the bacon, then onions, then chicken and I suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving. That way, everything is hot and the cheese will melt. This will definitely be made again in our house!"

The recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake. Only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. After that, use a spatula to mix everything else in, because if you continue to use a mixer you&#39;ll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture, which will make it less fluffy. Also add the milk and butter before the flour, because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture. If you prefer something less sweet, use 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 2. You could also melt the butter first, before stirring in the milk, just to make it melt faster."

Not only that, he&#39;s been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago.  Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time.  It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.

I turn mine into seafood chowder by adding 2 cans of escargot and tiger shrimp.  I also use my home made bone broths either chicken or turkey as I can control the sodium levels this way.  I  don&#39;t have to add any extra chicken bouillon.  If I need extra salt I add 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I always have reserve bacon grease so if I don&#39;t have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already.  It is nice to change it up once in a while.  I also use this recipe for loaded baked potato soup because it so much easier.  Enjoy!

I would do the icing a bit differently.  Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth.  Add confectioners sugar and mix.  Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined.   Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting."

This website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes. 

The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it’s too salty so I’m trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn’t look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn’t bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time.

I&#39;ve been making it for over a year, but I, too, have made a few minor changes to it.  I use a one-pound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links.  Then, to make up for the lack of Italian flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  And to save time, I also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach.  Like most soups, it gets even better after it sits overnight--assuming that it lasts that long!"

I usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking. However, I made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little.  The batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes. They rose without spreading at all.  It&#39;s important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high.

In the recipe I usually make, it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar (2 c flour and 1/2 sugar) so it&#39;s the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time I made this recipe I followed it as written. I thought it would be too sweet with double sugar I&#39;m used to tasting and three sweet, ripe bananas but it wasn&#39;t too sweet at all. In fact, the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious! If you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount, they are still yummy, but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar. Personally, I&#39;m fine with 1 c sugar. The only variations I use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 1/8th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking  because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops. I also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when I put the muffins in, drop the temp to the correct temp. I found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp. Supposedly, the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them. As a side note, parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them. Thanks for reading my long review. Again, killer recipe! I&#39;ve made it several times now with great results each time. Thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation!"

I substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste, and it holds up nicely.  I also use other fruits sometimes (black cherries with black cherry jello; blueberries with blueberry jello).  This is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible, as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day.  I typically bake my crust the day before, but wait until about 4 hours before serving to assemble.  Be sure to completely cool/chill each layer before adding the next.  Let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first!  Chill after adding the cream cheese mix.  And most importantly, let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top, otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and you&#39;ll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello.  Also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello, or it will get soggy."

I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn&#39;t like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I  had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one. I&#39;ll have to see how that goes next time I make it because we&#39;ve plowed right into the next casserole the next night; leftovers were as delicious as the first night.

Next, there are a few speedboats you hit while making. For example, the batter is VERY thick. Honestly, it&#39;s more the consistency of cookie dough. Dont try to use a hand mixer on this, it will break (been there, done that). The reason for that, though, is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking. It&#39;s supposed to be like that.

Next, it is VERY sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple; I always go straight for the big granny smiths. Anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload.

Last, the end result is a very moist, very heavy cake. Best if eaten quickly, even better if warm. It will not last more than a couple of days!

Pairs beautifully with some vanilla ice-cream, cinnamon, and caramel (never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe, never felt it was the right kind of flavor). Makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert, and it&#39;s perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings."

I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn&#39;t enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans.  Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal.  I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it.  Filling comes out firm so it doesn&#39;t spill all over.  Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect.

I&#39;ve been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years - and this is truly wonderful. I made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school.  I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left!  My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland.  (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.)  I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!)  The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture.  I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture.  (Just a few dribbles.)  I basically added blindly.  It turned out SO WELL.  Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering.  My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you&#39;re using something less insane like Frank&#39;s or Sriracha, you made need more.  Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy.

Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe’s 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers &amp; Onions.  I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe.  When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it’s done and delicious.  I also use Trader Joe’s whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories.  Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don’t tell anyone they’ll think you actually worked hard making it.  I love cheating."

I found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked. The Jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water. My guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on Jello box and not this recipe. I sliced up frozen strawberries as I didn’t have pre-sliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked. The jello doesn’t look as pretty as picture but that may be because I let it sit too long to gel in freezer.

My husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home. I have even have people complain that I did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs. It is a keeper!!!!!!!!! I did not put celery in it or the pepper.

I kno i will make (and be asked to make) it again.Its super crazy sweet tho. I will leave the powdered sugar out altogether in the future. I put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb... Its still borderline too sweet tho.We used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses too.And a little tip for the oreos... I used an already made oreo pie crust for that. It holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top. I just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottom.Still ridiculously good for 10 mins of work!

This was a good basic recipe and worth keeping.  A great template or just fine as is!     I added the salt after I melted the cheese just because  I didn&#39;t have a full cup of cheddar and made up the difference with processed cheese which tends to be saltier.  In fairness, the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be 30 - 40 minutes or longer if your potatoes aren&#39;t tender.   In my experience, it does usually ends up taking about two hours.  Is it my oven, the thickness of the potatoes, or the type of potato?  Who knows!

So for Valentine&#39;s Day I decided to substitute soy butter for the peanut butter in this recipe and it turned out AWESOME!!!  You really can&#39;t tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat.  I did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra 1/2c conf. sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didn&#39;t want filling to crumble.  Think next time I will add some crushed up pretzels to this and enjoy 3 great tastes together :-)  Excellent alternative for people allergic to peanuts!!!

I own a B&amp;B  so occasionally I need to come up with something for GF guests  and this particular guest is also dairy free,  so this recipe was exactly what I needed.   I made 1/4 of the recipe  and baked it as muffins and it was absolutely fabulous.   only took 15 minutes to bake small muffins  and reduced the oven temp to 325.   I probably used a little extra apple sauce (made it myself with sliced apples and oil and cooked till soft)  and not quite enuf bananas.   ANd I had my doubts with it being as wet as it was when it went into the oven,  but they rose nicely and browned and were a HIT.

I always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes; especially from sugar filled desserts. My bananas were small so I used 3 and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup.  I also use a non-egg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs.  Some recipes don&#39;t turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully!  I also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour; due to allergies.  I used half the icing sugar and added about 1/2 cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and DID NOT add in any stevia.  There was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet.  Some reviews mentioned that the recipe didn&#39;t make 4 dozen but it does!  I cut into 6 rows (10 inch side) by 8 rows (15 inch side).  They were the perfect size!  I took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

Along the way, we practiced reading, reading fractions and division (cutting things in half). Both did VERY well and we all got ?decorated? along the way. They had fun. Just call me Disneyland Grandma.  I do not care for peanut butter so I have not tasted them. However, the rest of the family thought they were wonderful and tasted just like Reese&#39;s cups and they were not just saying that to encourage the kids."

On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It&#39;s goooouooood!

IF  the jello fully sets before you get to it...just warm SLIGHTLY for a FEW SECONDS AT A TIME in the microwave till it is SEMI SET. BT not warm. Sometimes I grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops, before adding the pretzel garnish....If I remember to pick up some chocolate  covered pretzels for the garnish,Good recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to 2/3 cup....maybe even 1/2 C. especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type.."

Because others stated it was a bit lacking in flavor, I added some parsley, basil, and steak rub seasoning.  I also used store-bought mashed potatoes.At the end I stuck it all in a dish, and put it in the oven at 350deg for about 15 minutes.  Next time I will also broil it for a couple minutes too, like others suggested.One thing I did notice was a distinct sweetness to it.  I think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn.  Next time I will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie (maybe broccoli).  While the sour cream made the &#34;sauce&#34; taste good, I didn&#39;t really get a strong sour cream flavor (info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour cream).Overall, a good dish, and pretty quick when using leftover or store-bough mashed potatoes.

I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience.  Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you&#39;re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don&#39;t need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family&#39;s taste buds but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart&#39;s content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don&#39;t know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn&#39;t teach me much I hadn&#39;t learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20&#39;s &#34;Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not.&#34; One of my Mom&#39;s favourites: &#34; We get too soon old and too late smart!&#34;"

Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste.  I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them.  When cooking the  chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes.

I did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and also chilled the dough for 20 minutes before scooping and baking. I&#39;m really not sure why some people had such problems with it, maybe their butter was too soft. I will say that for my family&#39;s taste, I did need to add additional spice. I added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly, I could&#39;ve done with even more, which is why after tasting the test batch I rolled them in a cinnamon sugar/pumpkin pie spice mixture.

Didn&#39;t have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread.  I don&#39;t know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn&#39;t have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared.  The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around.

Perhaps the person who &#34;thinks&#34; this is vile, should go to a more mundane food website...one for people who are afraid of food. It&#39;s all in how moderate you are. BTW, my preference was to cut back a little on the sour cream and cheese. I eliminated the mozzarella and used cheddar and jack, added a little garlic powder and chives. It was great with steak tips and green beans with mushrooms. This is a bona fide review because i actually made it."

I have been baking almost my entire life, usually using my mom&#39;s recipe.  After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close.  I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don&#39;t think the pie needs it. I don&#39;t care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice.  (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.)  I generally don&#39;t sugar the crust, but that is my preference.  I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers.  To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples.  The peel should be dark green.  If the texture of the apple is &#34;mealy&#34;, it is over ripe and will probably be too wet.  Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom."

I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy.  I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense.  Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same.  Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole.  I&#39;d give it higher stars if it wasn&#39;t for the eggs."

First, I only use 1/4 c water in the meat mixture, and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing - otherwise they tend to fall apart. I use a quick rice. Also, I microwave the onion in a tsp of water for 1.5 minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients. Most importantly, I make 1.5 times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by 1.5 except the water, which I leave at 1c. (I use Italian seasoned tomato sauce.) This way we have plenty of sauce, as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes.  PS: Remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done!

I used cream of celery soup ( because I like the layer of flavor it adds) I too added 1C diced celery and shredded carrots.

I&#39;ve made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston.

I&#39;ve used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard.  It&#39;s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end.  I much prefer the softer crust.  As for the rest of the recipe, follow it.  It&#39;s perfect.  I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork.  Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I&#39;ve added the 4th cup of flour.

I didn&#39;t have wheat flour so made them with 1 c. all-purpose flour and it worked fine.  I read a review about the cakes being dry.  That is my thought on using wheat flour.  I have never made anything with it that hasn&#39;t turned out terrible dry so I&#39;m wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmeal.Here is something I tried for the first time and I was amazed.  I never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding 1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. of milk is a close substitute.  The article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon.  They suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk.  They said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk.  Maybe that&#39;s why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate!

I did add a few splashes of .... worcestershire because that was something I remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers &amp; with my eyes closed it was liked eating my mom&#39;s stuffed peppers!

I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs).  The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn&#39;t even notice it was there.  If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry.  This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread.

Make sure you don&#39;t skip the melted butter and flour mixture because that also will give the soup a thicker, heartier, creamier consistency.  I do that part differently than what the recipe says.  I use a small saucepan to melt the butter.  Then I add the flour and 1/2 cup broth (I actually use water) and bring it to a boil till it&#39;s thick &amp; pasty.  Then I add it to the soup mixture. Works great!  I also add 1 teaspoon of salt to the soup - and that is a personal preference."

In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use  a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren&#39;t necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet.

I also used a blend of feta, sharp cheddar, and sheep cheese which made it even creamier and extremely addictive!  I also spruced it up with a few additional spices (lots of garlic!).

I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.

I used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us.  I also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes.  I noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy.  Try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove.  My husband and son both rated this a 5.

I give it 4 stars only bc it was a little too sweet for me as well. And without the sauce the meat was pretty bland, although my husband liked the fact that the meat wasn&#39;t overly seasoned bc the sauce had a great taste. The only thing I may do next time is season the meat a little more and probably not put as much brown sugar. But I wouldn&#39;t make many changes bc my family (husband and 2 kids) LOVED IT. I paired it with some mashed potatoes and green beans. Overall a great meal."

This recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen.  I typically double the marinade.  While the chicken is marinating, I chop vegetables.  I have been adding mushrooms lately and it&#39;s a great addition.  I cook the veggies first, be sure to add salt and pepper.  Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour.  Mix it all together and voila.  I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly.  It&#39;s just that good!

Seemed to take quite awhile (at least 2 hours) for the gelatin layer to partially set. Then again, maybe it set too much because it seemed to slide off the cream cheese layer once it was cut.

First as for taste, it is good but for my family possibly too sweet.  For clarity, I did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which I think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor.  However, the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down.  Second, I also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected.  There was just too much of if and I used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs.  I served it with rice and there was PLENTY of sauce to go round and then some!  Finally, the cook time is way off.  Luckily I had read the reviews and noted this issue.  My chicken was done at 3 hours so I moved the crock-pot setting over to warm.  If you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get over-done dry chicken.  As I mentioned, this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking."

ALSO DELICIOUS.</p><p>- I noticed that the peanut butter really did not make an appearance in the final product (maybe I did something wrong), but the peanut oil seeped out of the springform pan and onto the cookie sheet. Which I don&#39;t think was a problem, but maybe add more peanut butter? OR perhaps mix it into the batter?</p><p>- I misread the instructions, and melted butter for the crust, but then (Stupidly) measured out 6 tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in. The crust was definitely drier than I would&#39;ve liked, it, so don&#39;t make the same mistake as me. Always add a lot of butter.</p><p>-I also didn&#39;t have an electric mixer, which resulted in a pretty lumpy batter. Luckily I had some extra muscle on hand to stir it up, but I think an electric mixer would have made things easier :p</p><p>- I added cut up peanut butter cups into the batter (before I poured the chocolate part on) and it was SUCH a good idea. They melted into the cake, and it was impossible to see them, but they definitely made the cake richer and more velvety. They added a distinct &#34;peanut butter cup&#34; taste. Very good.</p>"

I read previous reviews before trying this one. The problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details. Have your marshmallow creme jar open, and your peanut butter - I used Jif No Stir Natural Creamy Peanut Butter. already measured out. Prep your pan before you start. I line a 7&#34;x10&#34; glass pan lined with parchment. You must first bring the milk (I used evaporated milk) and sugar to a full boil - one that does not go away when stirred. I usually start with medium-high to get the boil going, then back off to medium once it&#39;s boiling.  You must stir constantly. Begin your 3 minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the pan off the heat! I immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla. Now you&#39;ve got to work quickly. Add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined. Pour into your prepared pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature. To cut it, just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface. Cut into 1&#34; squares because it&#39;s quite rich. LOVE this recipe! Plenty of peanut butter flavor for me."

My family did enjoy the bread. It was the first recipe I tried out.  Someone else mentioned this comment and I fully agree after making a different recipe. The bread is actually too heavy.  Nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy. The biggest difference between this recipe and another I tried was how many eggs.  The other recipe I really liked took 3 eggs. I may have said I would make this again but not anymore.

It took 1 hour and 15 mins to bake on 350 for an hour then 375 for 15 mins. The flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting. My grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery ??but this helped curbed that craving.

I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant.

To make it even easier (and the way my grandma did it), is to not brown the meatballs.  Mix the meatball ingredients, shape into meatballs and put in an even layer in a casserole dish and pour the soup mixture over.  Cook at 350, covered,  for 30 minutes. Remove cover and cook for 30 more minutes. Then I put them on top of mashed potatoes, spoon sauce over all and enjoy!

I bought all of the ingredients as written, but did end up with 2 1/2 cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as I did not want to toss them. It still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish. The crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping, as another reviewer recommended. I was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine. I put in fridge after first layer for about 30 minutes. Second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges, as another reviewer wisely recommended. Jello layer chilled for a few hours. Sliced beautifully. Looked pretty on a plate. Did not top with additional whip cream, and honestly it did not need any extra sugar, so that would have mainly been for plating. This is where I have to say, it was way too sweet. no way around it either but I may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh. The other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar, but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose. SO, aside from being overly sweet, this would be a very nice desert. I would never name this a salad or serve WITH a meal though."

Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs, and keep it a little on the runny side - it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature, and you don&#39;t want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs.

The key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them (which is very easy to do) 10-12 min max. You almost have to take them out before they look totally done. Also, for those who had issues with spreading, it&#39;s likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe. Butter makes cookies flatter. I used half butter, half butter  butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help. I think next time though I would use all crisco though.  I also nearly doubled the spices, I tasted the dough first and it just didn&#39;t have that ginger taste I was going for so I adjusted.

The recipe says to boil water then dissolve the jello in a bowl. That doesn&#39;t cook it any further and the bowl actually brings the temperature down. Did you dissolve it in the pot while still simmering/boiling? I wouldn&#39;t even boil the water. Just get it hot enough to dissolve the jello. Hope this helps and is in time for you to try again.

I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Upon eating one bite, he says, &#34;this has to go into the rotation!&#34;. We both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created. I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil  that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I  was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies. I did not have 4 pie crusts so I used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan, which provided room for the entire mixture. It worked perfectly!

I wasn&#39;t sure what you meant by topping either, sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom.  I kind of have  an issue with TOH in general, in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make.  In general, your recipes, all the ingredients are prepared - pecans chopped, cream cheese softened and then you start the timer, I wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch.

The only suggestion I have is to heat it longer than 30mins.  The finished product made a lot.  Was a bit drippy but was still very good.  Had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it.  Super yummy that way too!

Definitly different than what my mom made growing up (chicana) but SOOO GOOD. I rated 4 because using flour tortillas just isn&#39;t a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas, I would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish. They get soggy. I used corn tortillas instead (and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling, makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce) and for the sauce (if you like it a bit spicy, even if not they have regular sauce) I recommend &#34;El Pato&#34; you can usally find in the mexican section of any store. I use the yellow or green cans both delcious. Also, I chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese. I also baked uncovered for an extra 5-10 mins to get the edges extra crispy ( mi familia loves it this way!) . Served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious! Also, I did use cubed chicken because I used some left over breasts from the night prior but I will definitly be shredding it next time, my family didn&#39;t really dig that.

I have never had very good luck making meatloaf.  It was either way too dense or it would fall apart.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I did, however, add/change a couple of things.
A while back I ordered &#34;tomato powder&#34; from the Spice House.  I always forget that I have it.  But I saw it in the refrigerator (keeps it from getting hard as a rock), and figured I&#39;d add it in to the ground beef.  I used about a tablespoon.  I suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube.

I also used mostly 90/10 ground beef, but figured I&#39;d add some 80/20 in for some extra moisture (and obviously more fat).   My mom always used Ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballs....so I combined Ritz crackers and saltines...not really sure it made a difference.  Then I added about one or two teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet to the mixture.

I&#39;m not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe, but this was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  My 29 year old son, asked me if it was any good, and I told him to taste it and let me know.  He called from the kitchen and said,   &#34;Dad, this is the BEST meatloaf!

Also, I used a half cup of sugar, and added chocolate chips. For this recipe, I made muffins instead of a loaf, and for that I baked the muffins for 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for them. The end result was very moist, and delicious muffins. It made 12 muffins (I filled the cups almost to the top, so they were quite full).. I usually cut the sugar on recipes, especially when they call for one cup (it just seems excessive). I considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar, and may try the recipe again doing just that. I think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple sauce.TL:DR - Recipe was delicious!"

I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time.  I used red pepper flakes second time as I thought the Tabasco Sauce turned the soup a bit too orange. I like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well.

I made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my 17-year-old daughter.  Moist, homemade flavor even though it&#39;s from a box and has flavored gelatin. I was skeptical, but now throughly impressed. It was a real hit! I use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil. I used a food chopper to chop  strawberries. They were perfect! Not too fine and not too big. I used the frosting recipe - ingredients only but with different measurements, plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers ( not nearly as sweet that way, as others had mentioned), and frosted with White icing.  I tripled  this recipe and baked it in a 12 x 12 x 2 pan.  Only used about 2 1/2 of the recipes  instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan.  It came out perfect!   I used  nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper. Do not let cake cool completely in pan. Only cool cake about 10-15 min on a cooling rack.  Took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides. I noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit, but it&#39;s not bad. Then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake, placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment. Shook gently. Removed pan. Nothing stuck!  Just a thought, but  usually can&#39;t go wrong when a cake recipe begins with Mamaw."

Read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp. of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  The cookies turned out fabulously.

Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo.

The hollow sound didn&#39;t sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don&#39;t know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66  per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn&#39;t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I&#39;d experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN"

If you bake much, the lack of vanilla extract, and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat.  Also, for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy, remember that it&#39;s virtually impossible to over mix dough until you&#39;ve added the flour.  Get it good and fluffy.  Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if you&#39;re using a stand mixer.  I made the following changes/additions, and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends.  3/4 tsp salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tsp Lebkuchengewurz (German Gingerbread Spice)  I use a #40 disher for consistency.

I did some modifications this time to try some new things out.  This recipe is great as is but the additions were nice &amp; changed it up a little.  I added 1 C. frozen corn to the meat/onions in the pan.  I added 4 cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking.  I used 2 C. Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great).  I used 2 cans black beans.  Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer.  I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft).  Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 &amp; put it all in a 9X13 baking pan.  I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded &amp; more cilantro because we love it!  This is again AMAZING &amp; would be great for any family meal or potluck.  I would precut it for a potluck though.  Cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart.  Fantastic!!

The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product.  Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth.  That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons.  For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices.  My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef.  I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup.  To keep the cooked ground beef moist &amp; tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done.  The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup.  I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted.  Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger).  The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary.  I finished with salt &amp; pepper to taste  along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard.  After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard?  While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration."

I went old school and dumped the raw apples, cornstarch, and everything in a bowl, mixed it together, and it baked up just fine. One tip I think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets. Just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping (I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar).  Also, I doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using 2 packets of Apple Cinnamon oatmeal for each, for a deep dish pie. I just found that saving a cup wasn&#39;t enough for the topping, but boy was it delicious! I used a combination of 3 each Jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty.

You can try this if you want more of a bread texture than a cake. Still it&#39;s an excellent recipe... enjoy ..."

I read all the reviews before trying this for the first time. I agree with the review about the flour quantity. I cut it to 1/2 cup of flour but still the sauce became like spackle. I had to add an additional 1 1/2 quarts of liquid to make the sauce creamy. Next time I will try just an Alfredo sauce with butter, Parmesan and cream and maybe some white wine. 
Also, I added Old Bay to the seafood liquid, and subbed shallots and garlic for the green onion.

Doubled the recipe (meaning I doubled almost* every ingredient) because 1) hubby loves cream of mushroom soup, and 2) I had a lot of mushrooms I needed to use. *The only ingredient I didn&#39;t double was the flour. I also added cooking sherry (which works just fine).  I used 4 tbsp. butter, melted. Then added the onion and cooked for about 5 minutes. Then, the flour which I quickly stirred so it was almost a roux, but it was very dry, so that&#39;s when I tossed in about 1 tsp. or so of cooking sherry. Next I added 29 oz. of chicken broth (mixed of Swanson&#39;s organic and some homemade leftovers) and the mushrooms. I added some thyme because, in my world, pretty much every mushroom dish is a little bit better with thyme (for this I added about 1 tsp.) Then I let it simmer until the onions and mushrooms were soft. NOTE: I did NOT add salt.  When the onions and mushrooms were soft, I added a bit of the broth to a combo of 1/2 c. half"

It’s tricky to find that perfect balance between firm and mushy potatoes, but the recipe as followed yielded crunchy potatoes. Thus, I increased the heat and the cooking time. I used Gruyère and white cheddar, sautéed shallots, and in addition to salt and pepper, added my secret makes-every-recipe-amazing spice blend for flavor (<a href=""https://silkroadspices.ca/products/scarborough-fair)."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://silkroadspices.ca/products/scarborough-fair).</a> I also sopped up the oil that rose to the top with a paper towel, sprinkled the top with parmesan (maybe overkill, but if tons of cheese is wrong, I don&#39;t want to be right), and then broiled for a few moments before letting it sit."

I felt they were a little bland so I revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers  the color of the peppers depends on what I have on hand.Try yellow and orange peppers too. If you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this: After slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel. Then cooking. I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t be burping peppers all night.

A quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake (or to make any cake bake well) is to have room-temperature liquids/soft solids. I allow the butter, eggs, and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them. I always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature. I also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for all-purpose flour (it does make a difference for cakes, I promise.) While the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water, I wonder if Esteli had the oven pre-heated to the right temperature?If you don&#39;t prefer the frosting there are THOUSANDS of frosting recipes out there. Pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it. :)"

We also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnish.Things I will do differently next time I make it: I will use sliced GREEN onions in beef mixture AND as a garnish. I will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of Mexican diced tomatoes, and when I do that I will delete the 2/3 cup water, because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes. And I would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla&#39;s and spread them evenly, cuz those were tough to cut. I had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut. Even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatula.Other than my changes, this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it!"

The good news is that so far the things I have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so I will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interested--or I could just write a book--- LOL

The other half and a guest (unexpected) raved about them and asked for seconds.  This is definitely on my regular rotation for meals.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!"

First, it is yet anoth recipe for a family of six; I&#39;m retired and ofteen cook for myself alone (my wife prefers other things).  So, down to one really big Russet potato put through the mandolin at an eighth-inch setting, then cut into smaller pieces.  Second, the sauce as described (and then scale down) is too thick; I found myself addding more ½&amp;½ (more cream flavor, and not so fatty as heavy cream).  Third, cheddar is nice, but I also threw in some store-bought 4-cheese pizza cheese.  I also used some on top during the uncovered baking time -- nice lightly browned top.  Fourth, Imade this a one-dish meal: a layer of sauce, a layer of potato + a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham + a bit more sauce, another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce.  The baking instructions (adjusted a bit for a convection oven) were spot on; the covered cooking time; I added the extra chees on top, then did the uncovered baking time (again, adjusted downward for a convection oven).  A quick (and gentle) stire after a short time sitting just after coming out, brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory."

<ol><li>I skipped the butter the second time, instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it. When I used the butter, I got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan. I know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce, which is the base of this dish, but you&#39;re adding enough cheese that you don&#39;t need the richness butter provides, and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease it&#39;s not adding to the recipe anyway.</li><li>1/8 tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large. If you use that little pepper in your cooking, please never invite me to dinner. I know the recipe says &#34;additional pepper optional,&#34; but it really isn&#39;t. This recipe makes 8 servings. 1/64th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothing.</li></ol>"

I substituted whole milk with oat milk.  I used  pearl onions instead of chopped onion. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasonings.  I added broccoli when boiling potatoes and carrots. I added mushrooms when adding peas and corn.  I seasoned my chicken when cooking it with same seasoning as I put in this pie. I half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasn&#39;t under cooked. I use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter.  I would love to try it with Turkey breast!

For taste I would give it 4.  I am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes I made below.If someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe, but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize and/or correct the following:Salt:  Salt is necessary UNLESS you are using salted butter.  Most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe.  This recipe may have been written for use with salted butter, but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted, it will come out bland without the addition of salt. I added 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect.Batter: My batter was unusually runny, I would even call it watery. I have made cakes with very runny batter previously, but I was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn&#39;t mention the consistency of the batter. I added 1/2 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise. Your results may vary, however."

They also love the taste but not the texture of onions; because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic I pureed them along with the green chilies.We love cilantro and use it in most of my soups, so I doubled the amount used.I added 1/4 cup of rice. My daughter doesn&#39;t like the consistency of chili, so because of this and the addition of the rice, I used 48 ounces of broth; this gave it a chowder consistency.To make it healthier I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.I was in a hurry so I used a store bought roasted chicken. I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34; of the chicken.I served it in small bread bowls. It was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite."

It&#39;s cheesy, indulgent, gooey, comfort food taken to the tenth power.I made two pans, one using Italian sausage (that I seasoned with onions and Italian spices) for a carnivore friend and a meatless version for myself. Both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up!! Thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef, it really added richness to the dish.Other minor changes: I used two types of ravioli: cheese and portabella-cheese. I used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano.As far as steps, I followed them exactly, and it was easy as pie (and as tasty!).

You can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave. Just a minute or less for a couple of pieces. This recipe is very much like the Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix I usually buy.  If you like sweet cornbread you’ll definitely want to try this.

For the diced tomatoes, I used (2) 14.5 oz cans and partially drained them before dumping in the pot.  I only used about 2 tbsp of the brown sugar and no additional salt.

This is, by far, my favorite BASE recipe! I can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own... mishpachah...like family, my Bubbe would say. I omitted the milk. I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness. I froze the second Pot Pie filling on it&#39;s own to be put in a fresh crust another time. During this pandemic freezer space is at a premium. My new go to Pot Pie recipe.

I skipped the carrots and celery cause I’m not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead. I used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because that’s what I have. I used whatever cheese was in my fridge: left over taco mix and cheddar. It was still delicious! I love a recipe that’s easy to adapt. Thank you!

I made as written many times, but the last time, I added the entire can of pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I added chopped walnuts and put the mix into 2 smaller disposable loaf pans for sharing. It was fantastic! Great either way, but if you&#39;re looking to use up your pumpkin without doubling the recipe,  it will work. I think it&#39;s more moist and has more pumpkin flavor. Great recipe.

About apples, if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky.

I did do a few short cuts though.  I didn&#39;t blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine.  I only simmered the chicken mixture 10 minutes and only left the dish in the oven for 10 minutes after uncovering.  It still was delicious.  Ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken.  I&#39;m not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace.  The chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so it&#39;s not as noticeable.  This could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day.  Prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since it&#39;s the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day.  We are a family of 5 and so there is only a few small servings left over.  Next time I may double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8.

B/c of the changes I was able to make TWO lasagnas and I used the NO BOIL Lasagna! WIn-Win!!!I added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna. To my ricotta I like to add chili powder, egg, garlic powder, salt, fresh cilantro, and black pepper.  I think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish b/c it is a creamy dish.I did add fresh chopped garlic  when I cooked the green onions - BUT I also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooI doubled the creamy mix b/c  I used the no boil lasagna noodles and I felt the ratio of the seafood: shrimp (cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp (1lb), scallops (1lb), and claw crab meat (1lb) would have needed the extra sauceI did not expect to make 2, but I did.  One dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layers.I did noodle, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer, followed by seafood sauce. Then repeat the layers.  Be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce (without the seafood) for the top last layer of the lasagna. I did top that with Mozzarella too.  I didn&#39;t reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle, so it was covered with the seafood. I didn&#39;t want it to burn, so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on it.Yes this is a heart attack waiting to happen, but if you are going for it, then go for it.  I wouldn&#39;t make this everyday, maybe special occasions.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made it for a potluck.  It is a little time consuming, but oh so good!!! The other dish I gave pieces away.  I only wanted 2 pieces b/c I am health conscious. But no doubt with my changes it was good.I don&#39;t measure, but I used this recipe as a guideline."

But his motto is &#34;I&#39;ll try anything once.&#34;  He absolutely raved about this dish.  After reading many of the reviews, I made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible.  I didn&#39;t use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour.  Then squeezed it through paper towels.  I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20.  That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown.  I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking.  The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less.  This is a great casserole in which to &#34;hide&#34; vegetables.  We&#39;d love to try it with Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof.  All and all, a yummy recipe."

I used my favorite go-to homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust. I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples .  That combination was perfect for us. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"

I won&#39;t make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn&#39;t set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make.  Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely.  I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in.  Unfortunately, this still didn&#39;t really give the filling any flavor.  I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven.  I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t set as it cooled, and it didn&#39;t really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9&#34; pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5&#34; Deep Dish pan.

It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I&#39;m not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the  refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz &#34;salad&#34; bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn&#39;t chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend. I served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and, as I write this, I wish I was having the meal again tonight because it was AMAZING."

However, this year when planning cookie gifts for Christmas, I remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe. I LOVE these cookies and so does anyone who I make them for! 
This time, to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls, I took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball. This really helped speed up the process and my hands didn&#39;t get so messy. 
Also, I recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately. With the last pan, I didn&#39;t do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly."

Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups.  The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work.  The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.  I haven&#39;t had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before &#34;best by&#34; date."

I have made the frosting listed in the recipe, but have made other “favorite” frostings instead, too, mostly because I don’t use shortening. I use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly. Someone said the center comes out raw....the recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is. However, it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time. I typically average a few extra minutes and it’s perfect!!! It also does freeze great, without frosting. When I’m making shaped birthday cakes, I freeze my cut-off extra pieces as I’m layering and then take them out for a later day. Sometimes, I frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving, but not always. They’re great without it too."

I don&#39;t always feel brave enough to try and make the changes myself since I don&#39;t always know what and how much to put in to replace things.When more experienced cooks try out the changes I need and share them, I am in their debt.

Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta.  will be making this a lot this winter.    I used a full pound of hamb.  On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls.  Potato soup mix is:  in a pint jar put  1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water.  Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.  This makes a pretty jar for a gift also.  Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like.  Heat but don&#39;t boil.  If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes.  You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time.  These are handy to fry or add to soup."

Second, I also added some seasonings to the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, &amp; Italian seasoning along with S&amp;P. Third, to the broth I added the juice of one lemon.

I recieved requests for the recipe.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows, but other than that, I did not alter the ingredients.  However, if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of 15 x 10, you will need a couple of extra graham crackers (trim with a knife) to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan.  Fill the pan so the graham crackers don&#39;t shift around during baking. As another reviewer suggested, make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan, spray the foil with nonstick spray, and do not overcook the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture (only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter).  Watch the baking time carefully after the 12 minute mark.  At 12 minutes, mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle.  Try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone.  I let it cool for about 15 min and then removed it from the pan by holding the 2 ends of the foil.  I let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife.  The pizza cutter idea didn&#39;t work well for me.  I will absolutely make this again."

My family was very hesitant to try it because of the mustard in the glaze.  I&#39;ve made it 3 times now, everywhere I go they are gone very quickly.  I have been making them by using a 24 ct pack of rolls.  I slice the top off, put the bottom half in the 9x13, layer on the toppings and put the top back on.  We don&#39;t use the horseradish or butter or anything inside of the sandwiches.  I use a large knife to cut through everything after they are done cooking.  We use 1/4 tsp. Onion Powder because we don&#39;t like onions.  I&#39;ve let it sit over night and I&#39;ve made them an hour after making them.  They are best when left to sit over night but still good if made sooner than that as well.  I haven&#39;t had so many people ask for my recipe in a long time, they are so unique and SO GOOD, YUM!"

I didn’t enjoy the horseradish flavor. Just a personal preference, but next time I’ll use mayo instead. I doubled the sauce &amp; used a pkg of 8 sweet rolls. I had to put 2 of them in a pan all by themselves, which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them, more of the thin, crispy-chewy sauce stuck around the edges. So you got more of the savory-sweet chewy toffee for each sandwich. Next time I make them, I’ll bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them."

Should I only pour half the batter in, and then make again? Found this to be more cake-like than bar-like. I also put it in for 35 minutes because the middle was too pudding-like, though I was nervous about the browning edges (I live at high-altitude if that&#39;s relevant). Overall, an easy winner to take to work or a family gathering. I put salted caramel in the cream cheese frosting which was amazing.

My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe. I kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done. Finally I have a banana bread recipe I will be excited to add to our family favs cook book!"

Im sure it would add a lot.  I didn&#39;t have sharp cheddar so i used 4 cheese Mecican blend shredded. Worked fine. But these were minor tweeks and I&#39;m sure it is fabulous just as written too. Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin.  I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn&#39;t be so cold. When ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle. I will defimitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe."

I grate the onion instead of chopping it. That way, its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf. And finally, instead of one free-form loaf in the middle of my 13&#34; x 9&#34; pyrex pan, I make two.

I also use coconut extract instead of vanilla. That change made all the difference in a just so so cookie to a great one.

The alteration I made was: 3 tsp Ginger (instead of 2 tsp), 1 tsp Cloves (instead of 1/2 tsp) and 1.5 tsp Cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp). Also, as per previous reviews, I used 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of 1 Cup White sugar). I also added in 1/3 cup molasses instead of the 1/4 cup!These where phenomenal!! nice and THICK, just like I was hoping for. Countless recipes before yielded thin, weightless cookies, that lacked in depth of flavour. Whereas these are thick, hearty and chewy.

I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn&#39;t stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes"

I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the top of the peaches before pouring the hot liquid over the top and baking. It was not too sweet and the pecans gave it a bit of crunch. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream at a dinner party with friends. Delicious!

I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet. I’ll omit the sugar next time. I’d consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but it’s good. Note if you make this with cheese, it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk."

This is something I&#39;d do also.  Did you make any other alterations other than boiling the liquid a bit? I am anxious to try this, but would like to hear from you first.  Thanks so much. "

It was the perfect combo of salty and sweet! As other reviewers mentioned, it is very cakelike. I tasted the batter before pouring it into the baking dish and found it to be too sugary. I added 1/4 cup of milk to tone it down and it was just right when it was done. Next time, I&#39;ll do 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup but otherwise definitely a go-to recipe!
