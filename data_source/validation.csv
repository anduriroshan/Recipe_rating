The ginger flavor isn’t super noticeable though, if you, like me, crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste. I’ve made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies: 1. Replaced half of the flour with ragi flour. Ragi is a finger millet and has high protein, mineral, and fiber content. 2. Reduced butter to 8 tbsp. With the additions below, there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter. You could in fact reduce butter further to 7 or 6 tbsp since I found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls. 3. Increased ginger to 3 tsp 4. Added half a cup of shredded coconut 5. Added half a cup of flax seed powder   I haven’t had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin. In fact I’ve had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough. It may have to do with where I am located - even in the summer it’s quite chilly. I leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature, and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy. I also use molasses which is super sticky, so that may contribute to reducing the spread."

Next time, I&#39;ll reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top. I also baked it for 35 minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another 5 min with the door cracked.

I grabbed this recipe about an hour before I was to cook and was out of capers, so I searched for a substitution. My google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it, there were several options. I chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle, all it took was one and it worked great! If you use a spicy baby dill, also, be sure to mince it up, really fine, because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish, when it&#39;s cut up tiny.  The only other substitution I made was using 1 tsp   fresh minced garlic (= 2 cloves), because I think it tastes better than garlic powder, just my taste preference.

So much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpy.I  bought candy/sweet clear bags.  I tripled the amount of mixture.   I used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers.   I used galaxy bars, no cheap chocolate chips.  So  much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what i&#39;ve been told and I added Himalayan pink salt to the  mixture of peanut butter.Microwaves are bad for you so i didn&#39;t use one , i don&#39;t have one,  it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna.  i just used a stainless steel pot  on the cooker, filled with water on 3 and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mix.I did first layer put in freezer for 20 mins then did the peanut layer, easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard,  same in freezer 20 mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for 20 mins.  Then using a cleaver, I cut it into big bars looks perfect and great.I got 3 pounds 8 ounces worth of bars and 10 big bars out of it.  Much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups.  Anyone i&#39;ve made these for prior, absolutely lovesssssss the taste.So going  to wrap in greaseproof paper, then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag, then put into the clear bags, tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out  for Easter  :)Would be great fora photo upload function."

I would suggest if using frozen zucchini to let it thaw in a strainer first.The caramel frosting was very easy to prepare and flavorful. I used a bag to pipe it on.

Leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions.  Both are huge hits!  Be sure to cut the ham and cheese to &#34;roll size&#34; before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after they&#39;re baked.

Taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna I typically make, the next time I made this I added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms, and I used one package of ground beef plus I  added one pound of bulk Italian sausage.  Once thry were all cooked together, I  layered the ravioli  ( cheese only)  the sauce, the mozarela cheese, plus I also added a package of provolone cheese slices, divided, and I topped twitch one half a jar of Alfredo sauce.  I then repeated the ayers , endings with the red sauce and cheese, and baked as directed.  It&#39; is  a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together.

Capers are the unripened flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a prickly, perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean and some parts of Asia. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, wine or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives.The size of the buds range from tiny (about the size of a baby petite green pea) up to the size of a small olive. The smallest variety from the South of France, called nonpareil, is the most prized and comes with an equally notable price-tag. Larger capers are stronger in flavor and less aromatic."

My friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend&#39;s November baby shower. I volunteered to help, and after baking a test batch, we made just a couple of alterations. For the &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I&#39;d add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and  the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events.

We both thought the leftovers from this recipe would be better for reheating than actual stuffed peppers.  Based on other reviews, I added a whole chopped onion &amp; 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef as it browned.  I used 1.5 Quarts of reduced sodium beef broth and brown long grain rice.  I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme.  We topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty French bread on the side.  It was extremely filling and fairly healthy.  I used 93/7 lean ground beef, and with the additional spices, we found it very flavorful.  I hope it will reheat well as my freezer is stocked full of it."

What I&#39;ve started doing is mixing all of the filling together - ground beef, onion, pepper, water, taco seasoning, black beans and diced tomatoes - I also started mixing in the refried beans so it&#39;s simpler to put together and the taste is the same :-)  Then I divide the entire recipe in half.  I use 3 tortillas, half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish.  Then I take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container.  Next time I want to make this dish, I defrost the filling and then make another 8x8 casserole.  Works perfect for my family!"

Reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread.  Oil can be higher ratio.   The bread when it rises will create its own heat.  SO if you have dry flower that is why... change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs.

However, I did what several other reviewers suggested and used corn tortillas instead. To keep the tortillas soft versus &#34;grainy&#34;, I cooked them in a little canola oil for about 15 seconds each and drained on paper towels. (I know this totally added to the calories, but we don&#39;t like the flour tortillas because they become soggy) I did use more cheese - probably closer to 2 cups (jalapeño jack and cheddar). Other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I have to say that I always viewed lettuce and tomatoes on these types of casseroles as &#34;optional &amp; pretty garnish&#34;, but it is a must for this casserole! Almost tastes like a taco salad.

I added cinammon and pecan crumbles to the cake, and I used brown sugar. I put the cake in a Bundt pan. The icing was perfect with on 2 cups confectioners sugar, and extra vanilla.

I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream.  I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener.  There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you&#39;ve got a hit every time.

I made the chicken in a slow cooker and cooked with vegetable stock for flavor.  When done, I shredded – taste was great.  I did the potatoes, but left out the corn and peas as I don’t have.  I added celery when cooking the onions for a bit of texture.  Instead of pie crust, I made buttermilk biscuits and put on the top.  Using a small roasting pan allowed to have biscuits for all and it covers the pan nicely.  Try this, you will like it and so will the family!"

I was glad it made 2 pies; I was making one for a friend and another to keep. We had ours last night and it was exactly what I hoped it would be! Ultimate comfort food! Our very picky 5 year old loved it. He asked for seconds. I swapped the dried thyme out for 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme because I love using fresh herbs. I boiled my potatoes/carrots in chicken broth, then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy. I imagine using a rotisserie chicken would make this even easier. I also did a light egg wash on the crust for color. I will be saving this recipe as my new go-to for pot pie!"

Certainly not from the mountains and if it did I would have eaten at your house 1 time and that would have weaned me. Ain’t even close to what a dumpling should be. Balls of dough that you called a dumpling ( ugh).for one thing milk does not go in dumplings at all. A good strong broth is the flavoring of a dumpling   salt and pepper. A cup or two of cool broth to mix with your flour. Rolled out thin on a floured surface and left for an hour or so. Cut with a pizza cutter in 1”x2” pieces and drop into boiling broth and stir gently continuously to keep from sticking. Salt and pepper to taste and you can thicken with a mixture of plain flour and cold water . Add while it’s at a gentle boil while stirring. Turn down to simmer. It’s very easy to over boil and dumplings will fall apart. Do not put a lid on the dumplings. You can add shredded or cut up chicken if you wish.

I believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for 1 hour, you THEN remove the cover and cook for an ADDITIONAL 30-40 minutes.  That is plenty of time-- the potatoes were quite soft.  You DEFINITELY do NOT need to precook the potatoes first.  That is a waste of every working person&#39;s limited time.

I mixed same amount of tapioca, as cornstarch, into apples(which can be increased along with sugar depending on pan side) along with the sugar and put the vanilla in apples too; decreased the oven temp to 325-335 and baked until apples were done.  I also covered the edges with tin foil from the start. Never stayed on the counter very long. Yum Yum"

I also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know.  Sometimes I add some shredded zucchini, by decreasing an equal amount of banana.

Also, instead of cooking a pound of boneless chicken breasts, I use the breast meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken (Costco, in my case).  The breast meat is already seasoned, so no need for the garlic powder and canola oil.  I dice up the meat into 1/4&#34; cubes - a little smaller than the original recipe.

Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting."

Spread this mixture on top of each layer before adding final layer of sauce, mozz and about 1/4 cup of Parm. Left the ravioli frozen and used the jarred sauce that starts with R and ends with s.

If you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form.  I often bake them 45-50 mins at home.  Never had a burnt crust.  The convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster.  If they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller “2-bite” size pieces or eat with fork.  The batter is very thick.  Fist time I made I I though I did something wrong. You can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking.  Change up the filings, extracts and nuts or other add-in’s as you choose.  It’s pretty forgiving.  It’s kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe. Under-baking is usually the biggest issue, as is not using enough filling.  At a bakery you can’t skimp on fillings.  Customers don’t like that :-).  If you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day.   Bakery tip: For dryer drizzle use less milk.  It should be very thick - as in “not a drizzle at all” but kinda toothpaste like.  Then heat in microwave, no more than 10 seconds at a time. Gets super hot very fast.  Once hot, drizzle quickly, as it will harden/get crusty very quickly.  Once it drys on the bars it won’t make them overly soft.  Works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle (with few drops of liquid) and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with.  I burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it"

My normal pancake recipe only has 2 tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flour/oats.  Because we use syrup on our pancakes I don&#39;t feel like I need my pancakes to be sweet too--its just added sugar that is unnecessary.  So, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a delicious recipe.

I used one and a quarter cup of whole wheat flour instead of one and  half of white.  I used sugar free pudding mix.  I used one half cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  A lot of changes I know but it made a delicious satisfying cookie that is low enough in carbs for everyday enjoyment.  I tried it a few ways to come up with this set of subs and they produce the best results.  Enjoy!

I simply doubled the ingredients because I just couldn&#39;t see 1 pound of hamburger filling up three people. We used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opinion.Two adults and our 16 year old daughter. She ate five of the twenty meatballs that I was able to make for the 2 pounds of burger. I browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the 12&#34; skillet was a little crowded. I removed the browned meatballs to a plate while I disposed of the grease from the pan. I also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone. I returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce (2x recipe for me).Simmered on a low bubble for 45 minutes (turning the meatballs a couple times). They were just great. I couldn&#39;t believe my daughter ate five of the twenty I made. My only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized, and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs. I suppose the only thing I changed was that I mixed only 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs. In the sauce I did not add the water at all, just the two 15 oz cans of tomato sauce, 4Tsp of Worchestershire sauce, and 4 Tbsp of brown sugar.15 of the 20 meatballs were eaten. Only due to stomach capacity of 3 satisfied Kansan&#39;s. We will make this more often. So easy!"

That being said TOH altered my original submission of this recipe!  I don&#39;t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn&#39;t that what all cooks do as we learn?  One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don&#39;t use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don&#39;t blame the recipe!!   I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made!  In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers &#34;stay in place&#34; as I dislike runny lasagne.

I  could not imagine this with less.  Was the 8 oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing?  Regardless of the answer I will stick to the 3 larger cans but I am curious.

To eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this:  Cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly.   Spray the paper after it is in the pan.  After baking, run a knife around the sides to release the bread.  Turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide out.Peal off the wax paper.  Do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf.  I do this for all of my dessert breads.  I double this recipe and pour it into 3 -  8&#34;x 4&#34; pans and freeze 2 of the loaves.  If making a single recipe I use a 9&#34; x 5&#34; pan.  If doubling, I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and I don&#39;t add nuts at all.  I brush the glaze over the sides and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top.  Wonderful recipe!"
