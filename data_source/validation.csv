It is very rich so I only use a single layer at a time. The cake (minus frosting) also freezes very well.  Then I can thaw the cake and frost it for an easy item to bring.  I make 1/3 of the butter frosting recipe for the single layer, but keep the ganache the same.  I top with a variety of fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blue berries &amp; kiwi. Each single layer piece is still packed with flavor and allows for more servings with a large party."

I won&#39;t make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didn&#39;t set right, but I will be using the crust recipe (a 3/4 recipe) for the next pie I make.  Perhaps that will turn out better.Reserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick, so I reserved about 1 3/4 cup, which turned out nicely.  I used 2 different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in.  Unfortunately, this still didn&#39;t really give the filling any flavor.  I was amazed at how thick the water/cornstarch/sugar mixture got after boiling, but it was really jelly-like when I took it out of the oven.  I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t set as it cooled, and it didn&#39;t really.I will say though, that EVERY TOH pie recipe I read calls for a 9&#34; pie dish, but EVERY ONE I make NEEDS a 9.5&#34; Deep Dish pan.  Don&#39;t believe what you read in the recipe; it doesn&#39;t fit in the smaller dish."
